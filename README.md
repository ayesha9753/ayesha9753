## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a DevOps Engineer with a solid foundation in cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, Linux systems, and containerized deployments.  
I have spent the past year working on real-world DevOps projects involving:

- Docker & Docker Compose for containerization  
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation  
- Azure & AWS for scalable infrastructure  
- Bash scripting and Linux administration  
- Cybersecurity-aware practices for safe infrastructure

I’m open to opportunities that allow me to apply and grow my skills — whether in **on-premises environments**, **cloud-based systems**, or **hybrid infrastructures**.
